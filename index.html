        I am Ash, a LUA scripter that has developed for around 3 years. I also know php, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. (I do websites too). <br>
        My work hours vary day to day, depending on how busy I am. I am in the Central European Timezone. <br><br>

        These are some of my past works.<br>
        Please not that none of these are on sale.

                <h3>Announcement System</h3>
                <p>
                    This is an announcement system. Everything was made by me.<br>
                    The UI is customizable.<br>
                    The time that the announcement lasts is calculated based on the average reading speed of a slow reader (13 characters/second.)<br>
                    The time has also a minimum of 3 seconds and a maximum of 20.<br>
                    Since Roblox ToS wants that every string inputted by players that is displayed to others must be filtered, the body of announcements gets filtered.<br>

                <h3>Radio system</h3>
                <p>
                   This is a classic radio system. The messages are filtered due to Roblox ToS, but it can't be tested since it was recorded in Studio.<br>
                   The [TAG] near the name is based on the Player's team.<br>
                   The Ui is made by me and is fully customizable.<br>
                   The system was meant to be used for a project which was dropped at a later date.<br>

                <h3>Example of Game Settings</h3>
                <p>
                   This is a commission I completed.<br>
                   It's a game settings video (changes the horse arena obstacles)<br>
                   It's designed so that in a public server it affects only the player who changes the settings, while in a private server it affects everyone<br>
                   The obstacles and Ui is fully customizable.<br>

                <h3>Simulator</h3>
                <p>
                   This was a game I was planning to create some time ago, then I dropped the idea.<br>
                   It's a simulator where you gain money by eating, essentially<br>
                   It has a Rebirth menu, Sell Platform and Data Saving. It was going to have a shop aswell (and pets probably).<br>

                <h3>Animated doors</h3>
                <p>
                   These are two basing animated doors. They were meant for a project which is on halt at the moment.<br>
                   The first one is an automatic sliding door and the second one instead is a fridge door.<br>
                   The doors are fully customizable and everything you see there was made by me.<br>

                <p>
                   This is an Event Center panel management. It has different functions (not all implemented yet).<br>
                   The project it is destined to is my group, which is (for various reasons) not in development at the moment.<br>

                   This is for the same project of the Event Management System.<br>
                   It's a panel to manage interviews. It has different functions.<br>
                   The game is also released at the moment, without the panel.<br>
